# The boy and the Tree

```shell
A long time ago,
there was a huge tree.
A little boy loved to come and play around it every day.
He loved the tree and the tree loved to play with him.
Time went by…The little boy had grown up
and he no longer played around the tree.
One day, the boy returned and the tree was so excited.
“Come and play with me,” The tree said.
“I don’t have time to play.
I have to work for my family.
We need a house for a shelter.
Can you help me?”
“Sorry, but I don’t have a house.
But you can cut off my branches to build your house.”
So the boy cut all the branches of the tree and left happily.
The tree was glad to see him happy
but the boy didn’t appear since then.
The tree was lonely and sad.
One hot summer day,
the boy returned and the tree was delighted.
“Come and play with me!”the tree said.
“I am sad and getting old.
I want to go sailing to relax myself.
Can you give me a boat?”
“Use my trunk to build the boat. You can sail and be happy.”
So the boy cut the tree trunk to make a boat.
He went sailing and did not show up for a long time.
Finally, the boy returned after he left for so many years.
Sorry, my boy, but I don’t have anything for you anymore.
The only thing left is my dying roots. The tree said with tears.
“I don’t need much now, just a place to rest.
I am tired after all these years.” The boy replied.
“Good! Old tree roots are the best place to lean on and rest.
Come here, please sit down with me and have a rest.”
The boy sat down and the tree was glad and smiled with tears…
This is a story of everyone. The tree is our parent.
When we were young, we loved to play with Mom and Dad…
When we grow up, we leave them,
and only come to them when we need something or when we are in trouble.
No matter what, parents will always be there
and give everything they could to make you happy.
You may think that the boy is cruel to the tree
but that’s how all of us are treating our parents.
